## Motion Analysis

**The most important thing debaters must learn is reading and analysing motions. If you don't know how to read and analyse motions, you most likely won't survive as debaters; it's like trying to cook rice without water.** 

### Motion analysis is essential for

1. Knowing what to talk about in speeches;
2. Knowing what concepts you can apply;
3. Knowing whatever the fuck the debate is all about.

### So, how to analyse motions?

1. Look for the topic of the motion.
2. Identify what the motion is asking from you.
	> It could be to solve a problem or to defend a stance or assessing the value of something.
3. Identify what the problem it wants you to solve is.
	> Or if it does not have a problem, identify what problems exist which can be tied to the motion. There's a likelihood that solving is not the way to go; rather, it could be assessing the value of something.
4. Think of the realities that the motion is trying to point out; and don't try to stray away fromit,t even if it might be harmful to your side.

### Practice analysing motions, and try to formulate arguments. 

Here are some motions you can practice with:
- THBT technology has done more harm than good
- THW decriminalize sex work
- THBT the Philippine democracy has failed
- THR the glorification of opinions

___

## Prep Time (Asians)

**Yes, there are strategies and concepts everyone must know in prep time.** Prep time is not just *"Oh these are my arguments, and I think this and tha, and they might think this and that"*. Well, it is basically that, but that fails you most of the time. It fails because it wastes time, and it doesn't really help your team have a cohesive case-line.

### So what must you do?

1. Analyse the motion properly
2. You must have designations in your team   
   ##### 1.  Have a **Leader**.
      > A leader is someone who is good at motion analysis. They are the person who leads the conversation by asking the relevant questions.
   ##### 2. Have a **Builder**
      > A builder is someone who is creative. They are the ones who answer the important questions, or thinks of the arguments. They don't really have to be the ones who think of everything; their main role is starting the conversation by throwing ideas. The team usually follows suit by contributing to the conversation during prep.
   ##### 3. Have a **Devil's Advocate**
      > These people are the ones good at poking holes and criticizing the positive contributions during prep. They make sure that the ideas can stand up to criticism. They have to be good at asking questions that test the credibility and strength of ideas, and giving criticism. Furthermore, they are essential in making sure that the final ideas presented during speeches are solid and grounded, if not foolproof.
3. Have a main idea everyone goes back to as your main case-line. If there is/are none, you most likely would not have cohesive speeches. This can be the main goal of your house, or the problem you're trying to solve, or the reality you are trying to change/retain. Whatever it is, you'll always go back to it during prep and during your speech.   
    > For example:
    >> THW decriminalize recreational drugs
    >> 
    >> **You could spout the following nonsense:**
    >> * recreational drugs are not inherently harmful
    >> * poor mental healthcare is our enemy
    >> * and other stuff that could be your main idea/anchor

4. Make sure that you have a time for thinking, discussing, and prepping your speeches. For example, you could spend the first 5 mins of prep for thinking individually; 10 mins to discuss the motion; and 15 mins to prep your speeches individually. Remember that prepping is a time to formulate not only your case, but also your speeches; and it's not like everyone is a genius who doesn't need to contemplate first, so remember to have time for thinking.
5. During the team discussion, make sure you discuss the ff.   
   1. Motion analysis
   2. Case-line and stance
   3. Arguments distribution (what your arguments are and who says what)
      > i.e., PM will discuss this, and DPM will discuss this.
       > Make sure both speeches are not identical.
6. Before the prep time ends, make sure to quickly review your team's arguments to prevent shanks. (Shanking is when a speaker of the team contradicts the already presented ideas of the team)

## Characterizations

**Characterizations are the bread and butter of 1st speakers: It is how debates are set up.** ***As a quick tip, 1st speakers can often find the stuff they need to characterize in motion analysis.***

### How to characterize like you know what you're talking about

1. Start with what is happening. This can be an event, or a phenomenon, or a reality.   
   > e.g., The Philippines is holding its 2022 elections. This election is so divisive to the point where even families are infighting.
   > 
   > e.g., China is experiencing yet another COVID-19 resurgence. This time, they are equipped with the experience of their failures, and their citizens have experienced the horrors of the pandemic.
1. Discuss why **1** is happening   
   > e.g., We have 2 candidates who the people think are the best representatives of their interests. One of the candidates is the son of a former dictator, and convicted tax evader; while the other is a woman vice president who arguably has done the most for the Filipino during the pandemic. The difference in ideals, paradigms, and beliefs ultimately determine who a person is voting, and this difference is clashing against each other causing conflict.
   > 
   > e.g. The laxness of the Chinese people has caused the virus to proliferate again, and it is causing another surge of casualties among the population, especially impacting the unvaccinated.
2. Discuss why we are having the discussion   
   > e.g., The division between the Filipino people during the 2022 elections have caused harms against the electorate. People are hurting each other, and fake news is disseminated and believed in as if it was fact. Etc.   
   > 
   >e.g., We don't want the same thing to happen to our beloved country. The crisis in China is chuchu in (insert goal of motion).

## Argumentation

**Arguments are the bread and butter of all debaters. For some prime minsters, it might be the cherry on top.** **Arguments are the because of your case or model, or of the motion.**

### Basic Argument Format

1. Title
	- It is the main idea of the argument. It is the shortest answer to the *(motion), because...*
		>e.g., *(THW decriminalize recreational drugs)* because...
	- Think of something witty. It can sound good if you want. The most important thing is the adjudicator should be able to understand it.
2. Explanation
	- It is the analysis of the title or main idea
	- It is the most essential part of the argument
	- A simple "why". It doesn't need to be wordy or long, as long as it expounds the main idea of the title.
		>e.g., If we decriminalize drug use, we're more likely to prevent dangerous use by having regulation in the sale and quality of the drugs.
3. So what?
	- It answers the question "so what?" to the explanation of the argument
		> e.g., Not only are we allowing a safer avenue of using drugs, we're also preventing addiction by making sure that each person can't consume more than dangerous amounts. It also removes the syndicates and dangerous organizations who sell drugs at hyperinflated prices, and their violent mechanisms of business.
	- Remember to always try to ask "so what?" until you are satisfied with the depth of your argument. 
4. Importance
	- Why is your argument important?
		- Answer the question by citing the benefits/significance of your argument to the parties affected. 
			> e.g., This argument is important because even if poor mental healthcare is not solved, at the very least drug use is prevented from causing significant damage to a large portion of the population, just like how alcohol and cigars have regulation. It might not work 100%, but at the very least it is helpful.
