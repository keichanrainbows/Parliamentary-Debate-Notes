## Positions in Parliamentary Debate Format


>It doesn't really matter where the format originated, and debaters don't really know it as well. We all just debate.

In AsPar, there are 3 members in each team; and each member has their own position in the team. However, since it is a debate, there are opposition counterparts to each of these positions. Generally, and regardless of the side during the debate, there are 3 positions they can "main" in. 

### 1st speakers

- These speakers set up and introduce the debate and their team's case-line. They also provide their team's first argument. 
- The persons best suited for this position are people who are good at describing. This is because the 1st speakers must provide context and description of the debate and/or their case. 
- When 1st speakers are ineffective, the debate often suffers in terms of the agreement as to what the main problem is, or the correct context the debate must peruse. Simply put, fucking up as 1st speaker would mean the parameters are not set properly, so everyone just does and says whatever without repercussion.
- The special task of the opposition's first speaker is to establish the clash
	- It is the aspects where the Opposition Side disagrees with the Government Side
	- The clash is not a rebuttal; rather, it is a disagreement in the initial set-up of the debate
		>**e.g., Motion: THW legalize same-sex marriage in the Philippines**
		>* if Government Side sets-up the debate by characterizing Philippines as the most LGBTQ-friendly nation in Asia, Opposition Side can dispute this by citing how PH is the opposite. 
		>* In more high level debates, where the set-up is often undisputable, the Opposition Side can attack the mechanism or principles presented by the Government Side. 
		>* e.g., if Government Side gives the mechanism of allowing marriages regardless of religious implications (such as but not limited to church weddings or the opinion of the churches), Opposition Side can dispute by either attacking the mechanism itself, or the principle of infidelity. 
		>* **Note that rebuttals against the arguments is not a clash by itself, unless it primarily attacks the premise or set-up of Government Side.**
		>* However, note as well that Opposition Side's first speaker must also provide rebuttals.

>All speakers (except for the Prime Minister) are, by default, required to provide rebuttals. Although it is not a rule in the format, it is only logical to refute claims made by the opposing team in order for the debate to be a debate. In cases where both or one team is unresponsive, the activity would be more like a presentation rather than a clash of ideas. 


### 2nd Speakers

- These speakers provide the team's arguments and counter-arguments, and rebuttals.
- The best suited persons for this position are people who are good at grounding their thoughts in speech. Although being creative and well-studied is an advantage, a good 2nd speaker would be able to expound and ground ideas that might come from their teammates. 
- When 2nd speakers fuck up, it usually creates a logical gap between the 1st and 3rd speakers which significantly weakens the set-up of the first speaker, and preventing the 3rd speaker from grounding and defending issues. 

### 3rd Speakers

- These speakers provide the issues which have emerged from the discourse of the 1st and 2nd speakers. 
	- Issues are objectives being disputed by both sides. Simply put, they are emergent questions from the exchanges during the debate. 
	> **e.g., THW impose one child policy in the Philippines**
	>If Government Side argues that one child policy is anti-poor because of the relative deprivation experienced in terms of contraception or sex education; and opposition side argues that the imposition of one child policy bypasses the need for sex education or resolving the relative deprivations, and allows for more families to be catered by the governments; the issue is which side would be more likely to cater to the needs and interests of the marginalized.
- When 3rd speakers fuck up, it is usually because the juxtapositions were not well established, or were absent altogether.

## Burdens

It is not enough for debaters to know how to make speeches and make cases; or formulate arguments and defending their stances, no matter how outlandish. **One of the most important skills to have as debaters is being able to identify the burdens.**

## Speech Formats: The Essentials

Although there are several formats which debaters can adopt from several other sources, there are constants in all formats which are observable and expected of each role. 

### Prime Minister

Prime Ministers are the opening speakers of all debates; they are expected to open the debate by introducing the context and burdens of the motion. They are also expected to introduce the case or mechanism of their side, and consequently justify them. Hence, the following elements are essential in every PM speech.

#### 1. Context
- In all debates, the goal is solving a problem or assessing something. And in all those cases, it is necessary to clarify what specific context the debate must take in order to effectively hit the burden of the motion, and delimit the parameters. 
    > The context of the motion is the reality which must be assessed or solved. 
    >> e.g. Motion: THW legalize the use of marijuana
    >> 1. Burdens
    >>
    >> In this motion, the burden for Government Side is to prove that legalizing marijuana is justified, while Opposition Side must prove otherwise. 
    >> * _Note that soft-lining by limiting the legalization (or otherwise) of marijuana to medical use should not be done in this motion: it is not a debatable premise for opposition, and government is not tackling the issue of recreational use, which is clearly the target issue of the motion._
    >>
    >> * The motion is an assessment of the impacts of allowing marijuana to be available to the general public. 
    >>
    >> * It is also an assessment of the ethical principles which society has used to justify stigmatizing and consequently illegalizing marijuana in the first place.
    >>
    >> * The context, therefore, should be set as the recreational use of marijuana, and its current value and impression in status quo.
    >>
    >> 2. Delivering the context
    >>
    >> * Aside from
